This website, CyberFlix, was created by myself and two other team members at Texas State University. It mirrors a movie rental website in which a customer can register and rent movies. It used a server and a database that was on each members local machines.

*** Since this website was run locally, screenshots of the website have been provided in the CyberFlix4ScreenShots folder ***

- src folder holds all of the Java files and Servlets.
- WebContent folder holds all of the jsp files.

The servlets did the work for the jsp files and provided necessary data for the jsp files to use. 
The jsp files did all of the design for the web pages.
We used the Cascading Style Sheets from the w3schools website at the request of the instructor.
